Game explanation:
A 3D space-exploration game where you take the role of a brave astronaut from a depleted world, as they
explore strange and dangerous planets in search of a new home, nicknamed ‘Planet Hope’. However,
finding Planet Hope isn’t simple. The player must travel through many odd worlds, each with its own
unique environment, challenges, and monstrous foe. On each planet, the player has a limited time to
search for necessities of life, avoid deadly drops or falling hazards, craft upgrades
from scavenged materials and collect gemstones to power their spaceship so they can access new planets.
The player needs to be smart and fast, making decisions quickly to gather what they need. When the time
runs out, you will be hunted!
The genre of our game is a 3D over-the-shoulder sci-fi exploration and collection game, combining
elements of platforming, item crafting, and quick problem solving. The goal is to create an engaging
experience that encourages strategic gameplay, while still being easy for users to interact with. It’s
designed to challenge the player and see how they may operate under pressure. The motivation for our
game is to explore the beauty of space, feel the freedom of exploring a planet, and appreciate the
importance of sustainability here on Earth. Planet Hope blends adventure with a meaningful goal, and
symbolizes a journey of perseverance, curiosity, and discovery. Feel the accomplishment of finding and
collecting resources, the rush of being chased by a horrifying monster, and the honour of saving your
home/people.

The creation of this game has been divided into 3 main categories:
- Terrain formation and planet/gravity structure
- UI design displaying map information, gear status, and objectives.
- Character and item modeling
Each of these categories have been split between the collaborators equally.
